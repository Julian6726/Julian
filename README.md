#### Vigers T, Chan CL, Snell-Bergeon J, Bjornstad P, Zeitler PS, et al. (2019) cgmanalysis: An R package for descriptive analysis of continuous glucose monitor data. PLOS ONE 14(10): e0216851. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216851
## These scripts are easily modifiable, and our designed to easily incoroprate clincal metadata to enable CGM data to be analysed, and aggregated where needed, to be used in clinical trials
